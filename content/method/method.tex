\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec:method}
The proposed method, as well as, its experimental set-up for \gls{oct} volume classification are outlined in Fig.\,\ref{fig:ML-scheme}.
%The methodology is formulated as a standard classification procedure.
The methodology is formulated as a standard classification procedure which consists of five steps.
First, the \gls{oct} volumes are pre-processed as presented in details in Sect.\,\ref{subsec:prepro}.
%Then toward a final descriptor \gls{lbp} and \gls{lbptop} features are extracted with different mapping strategy and represented using two approach.
Then, \gls{lbp} and \gls{lbptop} features are detected, mapped and represented as discussed in depth in Sect.\,\ref{subsec:feaext}, Sect.\,\ref{subsec:mapping}, and Sect.\,\ref{subsec:fearep}, respectively.
%{\color{red}The feature extraction, mapping, and representation are presented in depth in Sect.\,\ref{subsec:feaext}, Sect.\,\ref{subsec:mapping}, and Sect.\,\ref{subsec:fearep}, respectively. CHECK THE SECTION ORDERING}
Finally, the classification step is presented in Sect.\,\ref{subsec:cls}.

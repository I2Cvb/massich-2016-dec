  Despite Venhuizen et al. tested on a public dataset~\cite{dukeBIG}, this dataset is intended to AMD.
  Srinivasan also tested on a public dataset~\cite{dukeSmall}, however the images are cropped and filtered etc.
  So thats why we collected the SERI dataset.

This dataset was acquired by the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), using
CIRRUS TM (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) \gls{sdoct} device. The dataset
consists of 32 \gls{oct} volumes (16 \gls{dme} and 16 normal cases). Each volume
contains 128 B-scan with resolution of 512 $\times$ 1024 pixels.  All
\gls{sdoct} images are read and assessed by trained graders and identified as
normal or \gls{dme} cases based on evaluation of retinal thickening, hard
exudates, intraretinal cystoid space formation and subretinal fluid.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

    Eye diseases such as \gls{dr} and \gls{dme} are the most common causes of irreversible vision loss in individuals with diabetes.
 Just in United States alone, health care and associated costs related to eye diseases are estimated at almost \SI{500}[\$]{M}~\cite{Sharma2005}.
 Moreover, the prevalent cases of \gls{dr} are expected to grow exponentially affecting over \SI{300}{M} people worldwide by 2025~\cite{Wild2004}.
 Given this scenario, early detection and treatment of \gls{dr} and \gls{dme} play a major role to prevent adverse effects such as blindness.
 \gls{dme} is characterized as an increase in retinal thickness within 1 disk diameter of the fovea center with or without hard exudates and sometimes associated with cysts~\cite{ETDRSG1985}.
 Fundus images which have proven to be very useful in revealing most of the eye pathologies~\cite{Mookiah20132136,Trucco2013} are not as good as \gls{oct} images which provide information about cross-sectional retinal morphology~\cite{Wang2015} (see Sect.\,\ref{sed:data} for some image examples).
 Therefore the growing interest in developing methodologies for \gls{oct} data.
 In this sense, great effort has been placed in retinal layers segmentation,
 which is a necessary step for retinal thickness measurements~\cite{Chiu2010,Kafieh2013}.

 However, few studies have addressed the specific problem of \gls{dme} automatic detection in \gls{oct}, revealing large ground to be covered in terms of: (i) manipulating \gls{oct} volumes, (ii) finding radiomix pathology signs, or (iii) appropriated classification strategies.

 Advances in any of those regards is of great interest since (i) manual evaluation of \gls{sdoct} volumetric scans is expensive and time consuming~\cite{Venhuizen2015}.
 (ii) \gls{sdoct} acquisition has some deficiencies due to eye movement during the scan~\cite{Liu2011}, the reflectivity nature of the retina~\cite{sehuman2014}, the fact that \gls{oct} suffers from high levels of noise and the overall image quality is inconsistent~\cite{barnum}.
 (iii) Coexistence of multiple pathologies~\cite{Liu2011}, easy to miss pathology signs~\cite{Venhuizen2015}, or large variability within the pathology treats which difficult to obtain proper radiomix to facilitate the task of classification.

 The rest of this article is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec:review} offers a general idea of the literature state-of-the-art in \gls{sdoct} volume classification. Section~\ref{sec:data} reviews some publicly available datasets and states the need for another one that suits the classification task here described.
 Section~\ref{sec:exp} proposes an experimental benchmark to compare different methodologies presented in Sect.\,\ref{sed:review}.
 Section~\ref{sec:results} reports and discusses the obtained results, while Sect.\,\ref{sec:conclusion} wraps up our thoughts regarding this work and its possible direction.

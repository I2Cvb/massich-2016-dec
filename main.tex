  \added[id=old]{
    This paper addresses the problem of automatic classification of \gls{sdoct}
    data for automatic identification of patients with \gls{dme} versus normal
    subjects.  \gls{oct} has been a valuable diagnostic tool for \gls{dme},
    which is among the most common causes of irreversible vision loss in
    individuals with diabetes.  Here, a classification framework with five
    distinctive steps is proposed and we present an extensive study of each
    step.  Our method considers combination of various pre-processings in
    conjunction with \gls{lbp} features and different mapping strategies.
    Using linear and non-linear classifiers, we tested the developed framework
    on a balanced cohort of 32 patients.
  }

  \added[id=old]{
    Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous
    studies by achieving a \gls{se} and \gls{sp} of 81.2\% and 93.7\%,
    respectively.  Our study concludes that the 3D features and high-level
    representation of 2D features using patches achieve the best results.  However,
    the effects of pre-processing is inconsistent with respect to different
    classifiers and feature configurations.
